## Hi there 👋

# 🌿 Hey there, I'm Jocelyn Yang!

🎓 Master of Information Technology (AI & Full Stack) graduated from UNSW, Sydney

✨ Projects include computer-vision pipelines, AI whiteboard companions, and PostgreSQL extensions.

Currently exploring how **AI + creativity** can shape better digital experiences —  
from scalable backend systems to intuitive, accessible interfaces.
