## Hi there 👋

# 🌿 Hey there, I'm Jocelyn!

🎓 Master of Information Technology (AI & Full Stack) graduated from UNSW, Sydney, after earning my **Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)**.  
💻 I love turning data, design, and language into practical, human-centered tech.  
✨ Projects span **multimodal AI systems**, **LLM-based assistants**, **data analytics** and **full-stack web & WeChat mini-program development**, covering everything from frontend interactivity to backend scalability.

Currently exploring how **AI + creativity** can shape better digital experiences, 
from scalable backend systems to emotionally intelligent, accessible interfaces.
